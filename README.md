This repository managed by NORC at the University of Chicago documents processing and analytic steps for producing weighted chronic disease estimates in MENDS.
NORC (the weighting and estimation vendor supporting MENDS) releases annotated code files at various geographic levels (national, state, county, ZIP code) for priority MENDS indicators (e.g., hypertension). 
The repository will evolve to align with weighting and modeling methodology updates for MENDS. (SAS)
